# Paper-to-Website
This project aims to convert a design into a website using its image. Here we are creating a design consisting of images and text on paint, which is used to generate HTML code.

5.jpg and 10.jpg are demo designs. It can be run using: $python main.py demo-image-path$

The project is entirely based on OpenCv. The bounding boxes of images and text are detected and text recognition is done using tesseract open source tool. This can be found in Detection.py. The code to generate HTML can be found in printHTML.py.
